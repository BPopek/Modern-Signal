            <p class='article-copy'>
                There are instances when an undergraduate, graduate, or professional student applicant, spouse (if married), or parents (if the student is dependent) must correct information on a previously filed tax return. If the individual is able and chooses to use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool (IRS DRT), the IRS DRT transfers the tax information from the tax return that was originally filed with the IRS; the transferred data does not include changes that were made on the amended tax return using IRS Form 1040X. Similarly, the IRS Tax Return Transcript only includes information from the original tax return, not the amended tax return.
            </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                Starting with the 2018-19 award year, during the IRS DRT process, the IRS determines if the tax filer filed an amended tax return. If so, the IRS Request Flag on the student’s Institutional Student Information Record (ISIR) is set to “07” for the student, the dependent student’s parent, or both.
            </p>
            <p class='article-sub-head'>SELECTED FOR VERIFICATION </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                If the applicant is selected for verification and the IRS Request Flag is “07,” the institution needs to determine from the ISIR which tax filer—the student and/or the dependent student’s parent(s)—filed an amended return and document both the original and amended tax return information. The tax filer needs to provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The signed copy of IRS Form 1040X that was filed with the IRS; and <b>either of the following</b></li>
                <li>A signed or unsigned IRS Tax Return Transcript containing information from the original tax return filed with the IRS or any other IRS tax transcript containing all income and tax information from the original tax return that is subject to verification;</li>
                <li>A signed copy of the tax return that was filed with the IRS or relevant tax authority; <b>or</b></li>
                <li>Unchanged IRS DRT data on the Institutional Student Information record (ISIR).</li>
            </ul>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                <b>Signed Copies of Tax Returns:</b> Effective with the publication of the <u>January 9, 2019 Electronic Announcement</u>, Changes to 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 Verification Requirements, schools can accept signed copies of tax returns instead of IRS DRT data or tax transcripts to complete verification. The Electronic Announcement guidance applies to both the 2018-19 and 2019-20 award years and became effective for any verifications being completed on or after January 9, 2019, even if the student was selected for verification and the school requested documents before January 9, 2019. Even though the Electronic Announcement does not mention amended tax returns, NASFAA has confirmed with the U.S. Department of Education (ED) that the guidance does apply when an amended tax return was filed. For more on tax return signature requirements, see AskRegs Knowledgebase Q&A, <a class='article-link' href='#'>Whose Signature Is Required on a Copy of the Tax Return That Is Accepted In Place of a Tax Transcript?</a>
            </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                <b>Use of IRS DRT Option:</b> Per guidance NASFAA has received from ED, unchanged IRS DRT data means an ISIR record with an IRS Request Flag "02" OR an IRS Data Field Flag value of 1 (IRS data transferred from the IRS – Field not changed by the user) for each data element required to be verified. The unchanged DRT data is the original information the tax filer reported to the IRS (not amended data). In the case of the IRA/pension rollover, if that was the only income data item subject to verification that changed, the institution could still rely on the IRS DRT information for the other fields and would only be required to collect additional documentation about the rollover. See AskRegs Knowledgebase Q&A, <a class='article-link' href='#'>How Do We Verify Rollovers of IRA, Pension, and Annuity Distributions?</a>
            </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                <b>Alternatives In Any Case:</b> As an alternative, the Tax Account Transcript can be used in conjunction with a Tax Return Transcript or tax return copy to complete verification without a copy of the 1040X. Also, an IRS Record of Account Transcript can be used by itself (without a 1040X, Tax Return Transcript, tax return copy, or DRT) to complete verification of the income data; however, the IRS Record of Account Transcript may be more difficult to interpret and may require the assistance of the IRS or a tax expert.
            </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                If the school received the tax filer’s tax transcript based on the originally filed tax return, the school should not request, and the tax filer does not need to provide, a new tax transcript. The tax transcript will not list amended information, even if it is obtained after the amended tax return is filed.
            </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                <b>Corrections Were Made By the IRS But No 1040X Was Filed or Required:</b> See AskRegs Knowledgebase Q&A, <a class='article-link' href='#'>How Do We Complete Verification Or Resolve the 07 When No 1040X Was Filed But the IRS Corrected the Tax Return?</a>
            </p>
            <p class='article-sub-head'>NOT SELECTED FOR VERIFICATION</p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                If the applicant is not selected for verification, but there is an IRS Request Flag of “07” on the ISIR, the school must contact the applicant or parent, as applicable, and make any necessary changes to any of the data items, regardless of whether those items are required to be verified. In such cases, the school can choose what documentation it accepts to make the changes. This could include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The same documents acceptable for verification;</li>
                <li>A signed copy of the original tax return along with the 1040X, or</li>
                <li>A signed statement explaining the changes, if the school deems that to be appropriate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                If such an applicant is selected for verification later, the school must request the documentation required for federal verification.
            </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                This guidance on the resolution of IRS Request Flag “07” is contained in the <u>August 7, 2017 Electronic Announcement</u>, Changes to the IRS Data Retrieval Tool Process for the 2018-19 FAFSA® Form. With the implementation of this IRS Request Flag, applicants or parents no longer self-report via FAFSA on the Web (FOTW) that they filed an amended tax return (previously indicated by IRS Display Flag “H”), as this self-reporting was particularly error-prone. Refer to the Electronic Announcement for more information.
                For guidance on which 1040X line items to use when verifying 1040X amounts, refer to NASFAA's <a class='article-link' href='#'>Verification Data and Federal Tax Forms Comparison</a> for the applicable tax year being verified.
            </p>
            <p class='article-copy'>
                <b>Note:</b> Prior to the 2017 FSA Conference, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) had indicated that schools could not rely on IRS DRT information instead of a tax transcript. However, since DRT data is from the original tax return, ED changed its policy to allow it.
